# Ebb

Ebb is a desktop app for builders and creatives who seek more undistracted deep work. Quickly get into focus, block distracting apps, track your time, incorporate music into your workflow, and stay accountable with friends.

To start using Ebb, simply download the application from the [releases page](https://github.com/CodeClimbersIO/ebb-app/releases)

## How it works

Ebb uses your window, mouse and keyboard activity to track your workflow habits. These activities are then rolled up into activity states, which are then used to generate working sessions to help you understand your workflow habits and improve your productivity.

## What do we do with your data?

- First, any data that contains sensitive information like app names, window names, mouse movements, keyboard interaction, is NOT shared with or stored by us. This all stays on your personal device.
- In order to easily offer you with a convenient solution to understand and improve your work habits, we do store your scores, sessions, streaks, and friends.
- We do not share this data with third parties
- We give you full control to remove your profile from our system at anytime

## Getting Started
- [Install Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install)
- From root of project run `npm install`
- Get a copy of `.env`
- Start with `npm run tauri dev`


## Open Source

- The tracking engine that powers Ebb is an Open Source project we maintain called CodeClimbers. We believe there are improvements that need to be made to the technology that supports tracking and we are pushing those developments as open source and local first.
